# Enola games

EnolaGames is a website where creative minds can play different games like chess, memory card,  tic-tac-toe, tetris, etc.

Purpose: It is user-friendly, and a player can easily search for the game and can play.

Our website covers all major mind games, making it easy to move from one game to another.

Build Status : During our implementation, we were unable to give points to players scored in each game and store it according to different players.

In Project:

suggetion.html, it shows more other types of indoor games.
